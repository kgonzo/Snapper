# Snapper

IMPORTANT: The program will not run if the python library pillow is not 
    installed, you can install it by using pip. Also, on Windows, even if
    pillow is installed there will be an error when using it. It is normal
    and the program will still run, but the image you used to run the program
    will not appear on the screen. It runs normally on MacOS and Linux OS.
    
To run the program in the terminal, while in the directory containing the run.py
    script and type the command:
    
    python3 run.py fishPhotos/{photo}
    
    where {photo} is the photo you want to use. Here's an example:
    
    python3 run.py fishPhotos/rainbowTrout.jpg
